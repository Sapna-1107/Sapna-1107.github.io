									  The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the nearest massive galaxy to the Milky Way (MW). Its circumgalactic medium (CGM) is complex and multiphase, containing both stripped H I structures like the Magellanic Stream and Bridge and a diffuse warm corona seen in high-ion absorption. We analyze 28 active galactic nucleus sight lines passing within 35 kpc of the LMC with archival Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph spectra to characterize the cool (T = 10<sup>4</sup> K)  gas in the LMC CGM, via new measurements of UV absorption in six low ions (O I, Fe II, Si II, Al II, S II, and Ni II) and one intermediate ion (Si III). We show that a declining column-density profile is present in all seven ions, with the low-ion profiles having a steeper slope than the high-ion profiles in C IV and Si IV reported by D. Krishnarao et al. Crucially, absorption at the LMC systemic velocity is only detected (in all ions) out to 17 kpc. Beyond this distance, the gas has a lower velocity and is associated with the Magellanic Stream. These results demonstrate that the LMC's CGM is composed of two distinct components: a compact inner halo extending to 17 kpc and a more extended stripped region associated with the Stream. The compactness and truncation of the LMC's inner CGM agree with recent simulations of ram-pressure stripping of the LMC by the MW's extended corona.

									<!-- Galaxies must obtain fresh gas from their surroundings to convert into stars and grow in mass over time. However, it is debated in what form this gas arrives at the galaxy: hot or cold, spherically symmetrically or in filaments, smoothly over time or in short bursts. I am currently using the Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies In Enzo (<a href="https://foggie.science">FOGGIE</a>) simulations to investigate the properties of gas accretion through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). These simulations resolve the CGM to a high degree, which reveals significant gas kinematics (which are responsible for <a href="research_nonequilibrium.html">upsetting equilibrium in the CGM</a>) that may disrupt the filamentary accreting gas flows. I am finding that the filaments do not stream smoothly onto the  galaxy and are instead dissipated before reaching it, perhaps by the strong turbulence in the CGM gas near the galaxy. -->
